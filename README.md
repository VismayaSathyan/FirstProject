# FirstProject
This is a school/student management system, I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP and SQL. 
this was the first ever project i developed with the help of NO tutorial. There's a lot of bad code in here but I am happy that I built something on my own for the first time and 
it did help me gain a lot of confidence. Had so much fun building this Project.
